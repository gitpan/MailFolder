-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added an %options argument to 'new'.

Added readonly attribute to folders.

Added a Create option to automatically create folder if it doesn't exist.

Added message labels. Added {first,last,next,prev}_labeled_message methods.

delete_message now uses 'delete' message label instead of it's own
assocarray.

register_folder_type is now done implicitly.

mbox now uses /\n?\nFrom / as the message separator instead of /^From /.

Added a 'create' method.

Added persistant storage of message labels to emaul.

Mbox now also needs the following modules: TimeDate and File-BasicFLock.

Mbox now uses flock instead of '.lock' for folder locking.

Mbox now checks to see if it thinks the file to open is a valid folder.

Mbox now synthesizes a envelope 'From ' if necessary.

In some of the smaller methods, eliminated use of 'my' and went
straight to members of @_.

Removed a call to stat in open method in Folder.pm.

Improved the cleanup in close method.

superclass pack now always returns 1.

update_message sets 'updated' label.

0 is now the official message number for a failed operation for
methods that are supposed to return a message number.

Consolidated several members of object into Message member.

Added documentation on some of the mechanics of writing a folder interface.

Fix a lot of pod formatting problems.

Added getpop.pl and from.pl example scripts.

Version 0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added an mbox folder interface.

Added dup method that copies a message to a given folder.

Added a Header assoc array member to the Mail::Folder object.  The
cached header is now no longer stuffed into the Messages assocarray.

Added a SortedMessages array to Mail::Folder object and added a
sort_message_list method for folder interface developers to allow the
sort only when needed (eg: after a set of bulk updates like in the
open method).  This should help for large folders.  The message_list
method used to sort the message list every time it was called.  It now
just returns the contents of the SortMessages member.  Besides, the
list_messages used to have a sort in it that references $a and $b;
this was interfering with the sort in the sort method (ugh).

remember_message now takes one less arg than before.  This is due to
adding the cache_header method.

Added a call to an init method to new in the base class.

Added several convenience methods for folder interface developers.

All of the methods that would alter the folder now require a sync to
commit the changes.  Emaul doesn't honor this yet, but will soon.

next_message and prev_message now take an optional parm to specify a
relative starting point.  next_message and prev_message used to scan
the entire list of messages.  They now start at the current message or
at the given parm passed to them.

Various strategic uses of map and grep.

Various bug fixes uncovered when implementing Mail::Folder::Mbox.

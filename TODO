+ Methods not implemented yet:
	threaded sort
	message status (unread, replied, forwarded, resent, message size)
	message_summary
	copy message into another folder
  Actually, maybe some of the methods should be part of a message
  class that abstracts messages a little more than what is currently
  available with Mail::Internet, and Mail::Folder could use that
  abstraction.  Geez, mail is such a pain... :-)

+ Provide methods for accessing $self->{Messages}.
  The goal is to insulate the folder handlers from all of the internal
  data structures in Mail::Folder.

+ Hook into MIME::Entity.
  The fact that Mail::Internet and MIME::Entity have different
  interfaces still needs to dealt with.

+ Do some kind of option processing.

+ Handle hard errors better.

+ Things to add to emaul:
	folder locking
	signal handling
	option for whether it makes backup copies of modified messages

+ Issues with MailTools:
	It currently folds header lines - this will cause changes to a
		message being written out where it is otherwise
		unchanged.
	The get method returns the string with the newline at the end.
		This isn't a problem, but it can be cumbersome for
		coders.

This directory contains a variety of example scripts using the
Mail::Folder module.

* from.pl

A simple variant of from(1).  It does minimal command-line processing.
You will probably notice that it is considerable slower then from(1)
or frm(1L).

* getpop.pl

A simple pop slurper based on Net::POP3.  It doesn't do anything fancy
like use a config file or store the password in encrypted form, but it
actually works.  If you use it, make sure you use the appropriate
permissions on the executable.  I might get around to adding more
secure storage of the configuration information at some later date.
Contact me if you would like to add that feature yourself - I'll
probably incorporate your chages into the base.

* xmailfolder.pl

A Mail User Agent (MUA) using the Tk perl modules.  This is REAL raw
right now.  It's bloated, slow, and a bad example of pTk code -
hopefully that will change.  It started life as something to use to
flesh out the design of MailFolder, but will eventually become a
decent MUA, with MIME and everything.  A future version of xmailfolder
will be alot different than this trivial example, and will rock.

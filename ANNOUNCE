The newest version (0.2) of the Mail::Folder module has been posted to
CPAN under my author id (KJOHNSON) and name (Kevin_Johnson).

This module provides an interface to email folders that is independent
from the physical folders.  The actual work on folders is done with
folder interface modules lying 'beneath' the Mail::Folder interface.

Refer to the provided README file for additional information.

This code is still in alpha release.  Think twice about using it on
folders that you consider important (at the very least make backup
copies :-).  Also, the interface is currently in an evaluation phase.
The interface will probably change in non-backwards-compatible ways.

I am keenly interested in feedback from folks interested in playing
around with the package.

Here are some of the more notable new features and unmalfeatures:
	+ Added a Unix mbox folder interface.
	+ Added a dup method to copy a message to a given folder.
	+ Added a call to an init routine to the base classes 'new' method.
	+ Added several convenience routines for folder interface developers.
	+ next_message and prev_message now accept an optional
	  argument to specify a relative starting point.
	+ Various bug fixes and optimizations.

Besides improving some of the existing features, here is the list of
items I'm focusing on:
	+ Implement named message sequence (ala MH).
	+ Deal with the need to hook into MIME::Entity.
	  I'm currently looking at a way to provide an interface that
	  doesn't need to fling Mail::Internet objects.
	+ Improve emaul folder interface.
	+ Handle hard errors better.
	+ Implement some kind of option processing.

The newest version (0.3) of the Mail::Folder module has been posted to
CPAN under my author id (KJOHNSON) and name (Kevin_Johnson).

This module provides a perl module interface to email folders that is
independent from the physical folders.  The actual work on folders is
done with folder interface modules lying 'beneath' the Mail::Folder
interface.

Refer to the provided README file for additional information.

This code is still in alpha release.  Think twice about using it to
modify folders that you consider important (at the very least make
backup copies :-).  Also, the interface is currently in an evaluation
phase.  The interface will probably change in non-backwards-compatible
ways.

I am keenly interested in feedback from folks doing stuff with the
package.

Here are some of the more notable new features and unmalfeatures added
since the last release:
	+ Message labels (or named sequences in MH parlance).
	+ register_folder_interface is performed implicitly now.
	+ Added a mechanism for dealing with readonly folders.
	+ Mbox synthesizes the 'From ' line if necessary.
	+ Mbox uses flock now (oops, I'm an old sysVoid).
	  (eventually the locking in mbox will be configurable)
	+ Added a getpop.pl example script.
	+ Added a from.pl example script.
	+ Various bug fixes and optimizations.

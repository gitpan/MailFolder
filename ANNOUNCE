The newest version (0.07) of the Mail::Folder module has been posted to
CPAN under my author id (KJOHNSON) and name (Kevin_Johnson).

... perl's response to the Law of Software Envelopment ...

Mail::Folder provides a perl module interface to email folders that is
independent from the physical folders.  The actual work on folders is
done with folder interface modules lying 'beneath' the Mail::Folder
interface.

The module is still in alpha release.  Think twice about using it to
modify folders you consider important (at the very least make backup
copies :-).  That being said, I'll mention I use it as the sole
interface to my email at home.

The method interface is currently in an evaluation phase.  Before it
goes to beta, I expect to make method interface changes that won't be
backwards compatible.

The current version was developed and tested against 5.003_97 or
newer.  Older versions won't work.

Here are some of the more notable new features and unmalfeatures added
since the last release:
	+ Had to nuke support for flock locking temporarily - sorry.
	+ No longer needs File::BasicFlock (a replacement is in the works).
	+ DotLocking can optionally be made NFS-safe.
	+ Fixed some race conditions with folder locking.
	+ Various bug fixes, cleanups, and optimizations.

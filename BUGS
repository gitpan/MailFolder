+ The Emaul and Maildir interfaces currently perform update_message
  and append_message against the actual folder instead of in a temp
  area that would be committed by sync.  This should be fixed before
  it's out of alpha release.

+ The Mbox folder locking stuff is not completely thought out yet.
  File locking of mbox files sux large rocks...

+ Since it's alpha code, the interface is still subject to change...
  In particular, some of the routines will be changed to accept lists.
  Some of those routines will require rearranging the order of their
  arguments.

+ Fatal and non-fatal errors isn't completely baked yet.

+ The regression test for NNTP is lacking (read: nonexistant).

+ There are some methods that still need to be written.

+ Not all the bugs are documented. :-)
